Resume
======

This repository holds my resume and associated template files.  I'm no LaTeX
expert, but I really liked this resume template.  I got the template from
[here](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/deedy-resume-cv).  All credit on
the template goes to the creators as listed on the page.  No modifications have
been made to the template (class and fonts), but my own details are, of course,
used in the resume.
